<h5> Program 1 </h5> 

Using methods charAt() & length() of String class, write a program to print the frequency of each character in a string. “Hello friend”

<h5> Output: </h5>

Enter a string : Hello friend

-: 1 

d: 1 

e: 2

f: 1

(continued for all character in the string)


<h5> Program 2 </h5>

Write down a java program to print even and odd numbers series respectively from two threads: t1 and t2 synchronizing on a shared object Let t1 print message “ping — >” and t2 print message “,—-pong”

<h5> Output: </h5>

—-pong 1

ping — > 2

—-pong 3

ping — > 4

—-pong 5

ping — > 6

—-pong 7

ping — > 8

—-pong 9

ping — > 10

—-pong 11

ping — > 12

—-pong 13

ping — > 14

—-pong 15

ping — > 16

—-pong 17

ping — > 18

—-pong 19

ping — > 20


<h5> program 3 </h5>

We have a Letter or a word then we need add some letters to it and need to find out shortest palindrome
For example we take "S": S will be the shortest palindrome string.
If we take "xyz": zyxyz will be the shortest palindrome string
So we need to add some characters to the given string or character and find out what will be the shortest palindrome string by using simple java program.

<h5> Output </h5>

Enter a String to find out shortest palindrome

my name is vasista

Shortest palindrome of my name is vasista is

atsisav si eman ym name is vasista

<h5> program 4 </h5>

Write a simple code to identify given linked list is palindrome or not by using stack.
First take a Stack. Traverse through each node of the linked list and push each node value to Stack.
Once the traversal & copying is done, iterate through linked list from head node again.
In each iteration, pop one stack element and compare with node value in respective iteration. It is expected to match stack popped value with node value.
In case of all matches, its a palindrome. Any one element mismatch makes it not a palindrome.

<h5> Output </h5>


Linked list is a palindrome
